Work in progress notes (wrestling-coach-game)

- Current focus: season flow tweaks. Next Day now advances one day at a time; dual day opens live dual view; tournament day jumps to results.
- Outstanding issues to verify: standings/rankings updating after duals (renamed teams now re-affiliated, but needs playthrough); tournament results view loads automatically on Saturdays.
- Recent changes:
  - Live dual finalization no longer auto-advances week/day; uses scheduled week in summaries.
  - Next Day respects live dual in progress (returns to live-dual tab) and triggers live dual on dual day.
  - Tournament run sets results view active and logs summary.
  - League filtering includes user team in district/region/state even if renamed; league update resolves affiliations for renamed teams.
- Suggested next steps when resuming: play a full week to confirm standings update per dual and rankings table reflects record; ensure tournament results render after Saturday sim; spot-check saved game load with new league fields.
